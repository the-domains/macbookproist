# The Future of Apple

The Future of Apple

So this last launch of the MacBook Pro was a bit of a dud. The new keyboard mechanism seems to be a bit funky, and then the launch of the 'touchbar' seems to have been a failure. I don't know what else would explain the rollout of a [non-touchbar Pro model][0], but there it is. Just as a quick recap of the issues, the main gripe with the touchbar is the lack of utility (it feels like solution looking for a problem), and the fact that it affects [battery life for no good reason][1].

And apparently, the issue with the new keyboard is that the keys don't feel uniform, and that they [make different sounds][2], which is very odd.

And seeing as we at [macbookpro.ist][3] hold the MacBook Pro in very high regard, we do not take these things lightly. I will proceed to make the point that despite a rough ride at the moment, here at macbookpro.ist we don't think the MacBook Pro is going anywhere soon. Here is why.

## For Developers - the only game in town

Even though they launched [Windows Subsystem for Linux][4], and that is a huge step in the right direction, my attempts at building a linux dev box to deploy to AWS Debian failed miserably when it became clear that the arrow keys for the Lenovo I found were not mapping correctly inside WSL; so you are using vim inside linux, and you open up the _.bash\_profile_ to add some lines of code and [the scroll keys don't work][5]. BOOM. A win for Mac. My [Engine Yard][6] account can spawn a terminal directly from the browser. Try that, Windows.

Look - I know there are plenty of Windows developers out there, and it does seem like a lot of Machine Learning stuff I see on [Udemy][7] shows someone running Windows. But my world is still basically web applications on AWS doing fancy stuff, and you need a MacBook Pro to work on that. It's a fact. That or just running a Linux distro but as I will discuss a bit later, the Mac ecosystem is still a big positive.

## You can still find the right model at a good deal

For about ten years, I found a way to spend no more than around $1000 every time I bought a new development machine. Except for the one time in 2008 where I started at the contract I currently have, and they spent close to $2000 on a maxed out (you guessed it) MacBook Pro, I have found that buying refurbished models and one-release-behind models can save you a lot of money and get you everything you need. And right now, in 2017, there is the added benefit that some of the new features are actually a detriment to the experience. For example: 

* the new models no longer have an HDMI port. Yes you can have _ANOTHER_ dongle to use a thunderbolt plug and convert it to HDMI, but I hate dongles and I really don't use that port much at all. It's just once in a while I like to plug in to my tv, and use the available HDMI port. It's just easy that that way.
* The touchpad - Force touch is just not something I care much about, on my phone I don't like it all, and on my trackpad I don't like it much either; so not having it on my laptop is a big plus;
* The touchbar - as discussed above, the touchbar brings no value, and impacts battery life, so no thank you;
* The keyboard - seems to be something that is less useful currently than in previous models.

So right now, buying an older model is both better and less expensive. Now, the $1000 spend limit that I used to have is no longer a reality, but starting at about $1400 up to $2000, you can get everything you need and not have to pay the starting price for new MacBook Pro because right now they are all priced well above $2000\.

Example: I just bought one of these myself. I need high specs for my work, but didn't want to pay $2800 for the cheapest quad-core with 512GB of ssd. So found this late 2013 model with the same specs for essentially half-price.

Look at those specs, and compare to:

## Ecosystem still wins - and Logic is a killer

Finally, the thing about Apple is that for the most part, the ecosystem is great. You know what I love about Apple?

You only buy once. Seriously, I have bought the same software twice so many times in the past. The Apple Store keeps that from happening. Also, iCloud is nice. I use my iCloud folder for basically everything now, and it means I don't really have to build my new machines from a previous image. I do a clean install every time because everything I need comes along with iCloud anyway.

And finally, Logic is a fantastic product. A lot of my producer friends are using it now. It is Mac-only, and is also a great tool for songwriters.

So if you hear someone talking shit about the new MacBook Pros, just remember one thing: when they finally get around to revamping the current line, those old models are going to go for cheap. And when they do, you can find them [here][3].
