            <title><![CDATA[The Future of Apple]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Future of Apple</h1>,<p>The Future of Apple</p>,<p>So this last launch of the MacBook Pro was a bit of a dud. The new keyboard mechanism seems to be a bit funky, and then the launch of the ‘touchbar’ seems to have been a failure. I don’t know what else would explain the rollout of a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/11/08/hands-on-late-2016-13-inch-macbook-pro-without-touch-bar-video/" title="">non-touchbar Pro model</a>, but there it is. Just as a quick recap of the issues, the main gripe with the touchbar is the lack of utility (it feels like solution looking for a problem), and the fact that it affects <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/i-returned-my-2016-macbook-pro-touch-bar" title="">battery life for no good reason</a>.</p>,<p>And apparently, the issue with the new keyboard is that the keys don’t feel uniform, and that they <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/21/2016-macbook-pro-keyboard-issues/" title="">make different sounds</a>, which is very odd.</p>,<p>And seeing as we at <a href="http://macbookpro.ist/" title="">macbookpro.ist</a> hold the MacBook Pro in very high regard, we do not take these things lightly. I will proceed to make the point that despite a rough ride at the moment, here at macbookpro.ist we don’t think the MacBook Pro is going anywhere soon. Here is why.</p>,<h2>For Developers - the only game in town</h2>,<p>Even though they launched <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/" title="">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>, and that is a huge step in the right direction, my attempts at building a linux dev box to deploy to AWS Debian failed miserably when it became clear that the arrow keys for the Lenovo I found were not mapping correctly inside WSL; so you are using vim inside linux, and you open up the <em>.bash_profile</em> to add some lines of code and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/111" title="">the scroll keys don’t work</a>. BOOM. A win for Mac. My <a href="https://cloud.engineyard.com/" title="">Engine Yard</a> account can spawn a terminal directly from the browser. Try that, Windows.</p>,<p>Look - I know there are plenty of Windows developers out there, and it does seem like a lot of Machine Learning stuff I see on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/overview" title="">Udemy</a> shows someone running Windows. But my world is still basically web applications on AWS doing fancy stuff, and you need a MacBook Pro to work on that. It’s a fact. That or just running a Linux distro but as I will discuss a bit later, the Mac ecosystem is still a big positive.</p>,<h2>You can still find the right model at a good deal</h2>,<p>For about ten years, I found a way to spend no more than around $1000 every time I bought a new development machine. Except for the one time in 2008 where I started at the contract I currently have, and they spent close to $2000 on a maxed out (you guessed it) MacBook Pro, I have found that buying refurbished models and one-release-behind models can save you a lot of money and get you everything you need. And right now, in 2017, there is the added benefit that some of the new features are actually a detriment to the experience. For example: </p>,<ul><li>the new models no longer have an HDMI port. Yes you can have <em>ANOTHER</em> dongle to use a thunderbolt plug and convert it to HDMI, but I hate dongles and I really don’t use that port much at all. It’s just once in a while I like to plug in to my tv, and use the available HDMI port. It’s just easy that that way.</li><li>The touchpad - Force touch is just not something I care much about, on my phone I don’t like it all, and on my trackpad I don’t like it much either; so not having it on my laptop is a big plus;</li><li>The touchbar - as discussed above, the touchbar brings no value, and impacts battery life, so no thank you;</li><li>The keyboard - seems to be something that is less useful currently than in previous models.</li></ul>,<p>So right now, buying an older model is both better and less expensive. Now, the $1000 spend limit that I used to have is no longer a reality, but starting at about $1400 up to $2000, you can get everything you need and not have to pay the starting price for new MacBook Pro because right now they are all priced well above $2000.</p>,<p>Example: I just bought one of these myself. I need high specs for my work, but didn’t want to pay $2800 for the cheapest quad-core with 512GB of ssd. So found this late 2013 model with the same specs for essentially half-price.</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNUstu2zAQvOcrDB14c0TLttw4povmkj4QpICR9kgw5FIiTJEKuY7invIh7c_lS0LRDtA97c4uZwa73CjzPIl4tMDeXv8ivOBUWNO4tQSHEK7fXv9tLy42RgfRwXmwGIzCdj2raP9y3YJpWlxXi7EoJp0IjXF5gBX0oz4NZSDK4K01rmGF88Uk8z76oCCc2kGyoiyHOHXiUnTij3dToeIxInSX0ndlom4AY_n0eQfh2Uj4BSEa71hF6Yp-qipy7-D7js3IfQ9B4Ni6BfyivmJnyZ0Ie8CfVkhgDzsS_SGkTEgSQLMnzWPPRTSOo7FEKI7HHlgfvDpI5Mn0nmAQcp_cc6OYiK0VThk_rSjpMnOfmU--E2czqiedDHdpo-yG0tvq7mb14zcZheL_wCjwTbElpUJrWM2XVbXQs1mt54srvdRLoPSqVjWJrR_4eWcYDpAfct-Dizx5dzDwwTjlB6aFjUD6kNbEpbc-sHkOggbtB0RpXUtKHptzrXMU49nL0923mzJ9k-07nIrDQA" height="320"></iframe>,<p>Look at those specs, and compare to:</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d674824e-7e4f-47f7-aff2-7ebf3791009e.png">,<h2>Ecosystem still wins -  and Logic is a killer</h2>,<p>Finally, the thing about Apple is that for the most part, the ecosystem is great. You know what I love about Apple?</p>,<p>You only buy once. Seriously, I have bought the same software twice so many times in the past. The Apple Store keeps that from happening. Also, iCloud is nice. I use my iCloud folder for basically everything now, and it means I don’t really have to build my new machines from a previous image. I do a clean install every time because everything I need comes along with iCloud anyway.</p>,<p>And finally, Logic is a fantastic product. A lot of my producer friends are using it now. It is Mac-only, and is also a great tool for songwriters.</p>,<p>So if you hear someone talking shit about the new MacBook Pros, just remember one thing: when they finally get around to revamping the current line, those old models are going to go for cheap. And when they do, you can find them <a href="http://macbookpro.ist/" title="">here</a>.</p>]]></description>
